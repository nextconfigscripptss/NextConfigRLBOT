Latest release: NextBot v2.1
What's new in this update:
- Demo Defender: Bot will attempt to demo/bump if near the opponent’s net and teammate can easily score.
- Optimizations: Enhanced performance and stability.
- Improved NextFucker Logic: Bot no longer freezes if the opponent is demoed. Now, it continues playing as usual (Freeplay mode works, but not yet for air dribbling).
- Config Save: Save configurations to avoid re-entering settings each time you launch NextBot.
- Customizable Toggle Bind: You can now change the toggle bind, even assigning it to a controller button.
- Kickoff Enhancements: Better kickoff logic for faster starts and better 50/50.


Configuration Guide:
(These checks must all be met for the bot to initiate Air Dribbling.)
Min Boost: Minimum boost level required.
Max Ball Distance: Maximum distance between the bot and the ball.
Opponent Distance: Minimum safe distance from an opponent.
Max Wall Distance: Maximum distance from the right wall.
